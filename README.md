# Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
This code analyzes Boston.csv by finding the sum, mean, median, range of two vectors and then calculating the covariance and correlation between the vectors.
A link to the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/2_Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.cpp).

The document summarizes the output of the code and describes the usage of the mean, median, and range functions as well as the covariance and correlation functions in relation to data analysis.

# Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models
This code performs regression and classification analyses on two data sets.

A link to the regression pdf can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Regression.pdf).

A link to the classification pdf can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Classification.pdf).

# Portfolio Component 3: Machine Learning from Scratch
Logistic regression and naive bayes are coded from scratch and performed on the titanic data set.

A link to the logistic regression code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/logistic_regression.cpp).

A link to the naive bayes code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/naive-bayes.cpp).
