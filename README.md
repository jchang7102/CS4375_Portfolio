# Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
This code analyzes Boston.csv by finding the sum, mean, median, range of two vectors and then calculating the covariance and correlation between the vectors.
A link to the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/2_Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.cpp).

The document summarizes the output of the code and describes the usage of the mean, median, and range functions as well as the covariance and correlation functions in relation to data analysis.

# Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models
This code performs regression and classification analyses on two data sets.

# Portfolio Component 3: Machine Learning from Scratch
Logistic regression and naive bayes are coded from scratch and performed on the titanic data set.

A link to the logistic regression code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jchang7102/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/logistic_regression.cpp).

# Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity
For this assignment, I worked with classmates to create similarity models, clustering methods, and dimensionality reduction techniques as a basis for comparison.

# Portfolio Component 5: Kernel and Ensemble Methods
SVM is applied to linear regression and classification methods using linear, polynomial, and radial kernels. Then, the ensemble techniques of random forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost are applied to the classification dataset with decision tree as a baseline.
